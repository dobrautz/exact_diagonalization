% % NOTE: 23.05.13: changes from 1 dimensional instance of this function:
%   up until calculation of translationMatrix overlap code nearly exactly
%   the same. then have to extract X and Y translation component of symmetry
%   operations leaving UP spin invariant from symOpInvariantsUp and
%   symOp2ReprUp. change in respective indications and symmetry applications, and
%   calculation of exponential phases. plus have to apply new version of
%   translationMatrix overlap calculation.
% NOTE: 28.05.13: adaptation to new saving of down spin representatives
%  not much to do here, since i still save hubbard norm in old way. just
%  have to take care when i pick out compatible down spin parts
%  also made changes to memory efficiency
% NOTE: 03.06.13: found mistake which gave me wrong results for only
% translational symmetry comapered to no symmetry case: was in overlap
% matrix calculation <D'|Tx^jx Ty^jy|D> the power of translation was
% applied in wrong direction! changed in overlap cal. function to minus
% sign!
% NOTE: 22.06.13: parallized second loop over connnected states
